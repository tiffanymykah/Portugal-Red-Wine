Dashboard Overview

We will be creating a dashboard which will be a storyboard of the different effects of wine quality.
 We will plot different graphs of different wine attributes to represent wine quality. 
For example, we can show the effect when acid is added on, the amount of sulfur dioxide, alcohol, or PH level. 
The wine may have different tastes with each of these ingredients.
