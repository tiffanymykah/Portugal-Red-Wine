# Project Topic

The topic of the project is Red Wine Qulality Prediction

## Reason for selecting the topic

Red wine being the favorite beverage among the group, we decided to analyze it's quality basis the features available in the dataset. 
The goal of selecting this topic is to investigate how the physicochemical (inputs) like alcohol %,chlorides,sulphates content etc varies 
the quality of Wine. 
By the use of several Machine learning models, we will predict the quality of the wine as either good or average

## Description of the source of data

For the analysis, we will use Red Wine Quality Data Set of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine., available on the UCI machine learning 
repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 
2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no
data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

The dataset contains a total of 12 variables, which were recorded for 1,599 observations.

Attribute Information:

1. Fixed acidity : Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile.(do not evaporate readily)
2. Volatile acidity : The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.
3. Citric acid : Found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.
4. Residual sugar : The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, itâ€™s rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines 
   with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.
5. Chlorides : The amount of salt in the wine.
6. Free sulfur dioxide : The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents 
   microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.
7. Total sulfur dioxide : Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 
   concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.
8. Density : The density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.
9. pH : Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.
10. Sulphates : A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
11. Alcohol : The percent alcohol content of the wine.

Target Variable : 

12. Description : Based on physiochemical data
